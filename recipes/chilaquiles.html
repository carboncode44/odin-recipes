        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

        <p>At its most basic, chilaquiles consist of fried corn tortilla chips simmered in a brothy sauce. Not only is this dish affordable, but it’s also great for entertaining since both major components (the chips and the sauce) can be made in advance. Chilaquiles are also a great meatless option, and amazing for weeknights when you’re in need of a dish that’s ready in under 30 minutes.</p>

        <p>The beauty of chilaquiles is they are completely customizable. Serve with a scrambled or fried egg on top, or with cheese, shredded chicken, or roasted veggies — the options are endless. Because it’s so versatile, this dish is the perfect opportunity to use up any leftovers found in the fridge. If you’re short on time, you can swap in that bag of stale tortilla chips in your pantry for the homemade chips in this recipe. </p>

            <li>1/2 large yellow onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup of vegetable broth or water</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul></p>
   
   
        <p><h3><em>For Serving</em></h3></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Avocado</li>
            <li>Crema</li>
            <li>Queso Fresco</li>
            <li>Fried eggs</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fry the tortillas.</strong> Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add about a quarter of the tortilla wedges and cook, flipping once, until lightly brown and crisp.</li>
            <li><strong>Drain the tortilla chips.</strong> Drain the freshly fried tortilla chips on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Repeat this process until all tortillas are fried, adding more oil if needed. </li>
            <li><strong>Make the salsa roja.</strong>Place the tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, and garlic in a blender or food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Pour in 1 cup of the broth. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Salsa.</strong>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the salsa and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes (the consistency of the salsa will vary depending on the size and juiciness of the tomatoes). Add additional broth to thin out the salsa, if needed. Taste and season with salt as needed</li>
            <li><strong>Coat the chips with the salsa.</strong>Add the tortilla chips and stir carefully to coat the chips. Cook until the tortillas are heated through, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with salt as needed</li>
            <li><strong>Serve Warm.</strong>Serve warm. Serve warm garnished with avocado or guacamole, crema, queso fresco, and/or fried eggs, if desired. </li>
